# RebootingRebels ( Same instructions as previous assignment )
Download the project on the local machine

Open your VSC( Visual Studio Code), and open this foler in it, 

Start new Terminal, from the Terminal Menu

Install node_modules by writing "npm install node" or "npm install npm"

Install expo-cli by writing "npm install -g expo-cli"

check expo version by, expo --version,

check node version by, node --version,

put the command to see the project working, "yarn start"

If there is some "icon" errors such as "font not installed,etc" try to use the "npx expo fix" commands provided while runtime, it will solve that errors 

Open with Either Android, or any of the Options, but I recommend Android as, it was tested in that, so, after "yarn start", press "a"

It will start the Android Simulator, if it already have it open, it will initiate in that. ThAT's IT!
